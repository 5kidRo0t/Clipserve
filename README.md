## 🚀 What’s New?

This update significantly **enhances the security** of your clipboard history by generating a **new encryption key every time the script starts**. 🔑✨

Instead of relying on a **fixed, hardcoded key**, the encryption key is now created **dynamically per session**, ensuring that:

- 🔒 Clipboard contents are protected with a fresh key on each run.  
- 🔑 Risks related to key exposure are greatly mitigated.  
- 🛡️ Overall confidentiality of stored clipboard data is improved.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Storing sensitive clipboard data demands strong security measures. With this dynamic session-based key:

- Your clipboard history is safer against unauthorized access.  
- Every session is uniquely encrypted, preventing replay or key reuse attacks.  
- Peace of mind that your data isn’t encrypted with stale or exposed keys.

Feel free to try it out and enhance your clipboard security today! 🚀
